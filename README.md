# Project Report

Your group report will be written up on Github (formatted with Markdown) as the front page of your team’s repo, within the module’s Github organisation: https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110. Please follow the report structure below. For each section we want to see that you’ve engaged with the taught material and reflected on your process. You can also demonstrate that you’ve gone beyond the taught component. We’ve given a rough indicator of how long each section could be, however we won’t be penalising you if you go under or over (within reason!). Include as many figures, tables, and references as you need.
