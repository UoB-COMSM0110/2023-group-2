# Project Report

Your group report will be written up on Github (formatted with Markdown) as the front page of your team’s repo, within the module’s Github organisation: https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110. Please follow the report structure below. For each section we want to see that you’ve engaged with the taught material and reflected on your process. You can also demonstrate that you’ve gone beyond the taught component. We’ve given a rough indicator of how long each section could be, however we won’t be penalising you if you go under or over (within reason!). Include as many figures, tables, and references as you need.

## Introduction (5% ~250 words)

Our game is based on the classic arcade game Pacman. In this game, the entity controlled by the player moves around in a 2D maze while trying to collect all the coins. At the same time, a collection of ghosts hunt Pacman, and if they catch it the player loses a life. If the player loses all their lives, it is game over. If Pacman collects all the coins, it moves on to the next level.
Our twist is to restrict the visibility of the maze to the player. Instead of being able to see the entire maze, there is a circle of visibility which follows Pacman around, and anything outside of that circle is hidden behind a "fog". We hope that this will provide a new sense of unpredictability and excitement to the game. Furthermore, we plan to add more features to the maze, such as "slippy" areas which make it more difficult to control the movement of Pacman.

## Requirements (15% ~750 words)

Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

## Design (15% ~750 words)

## Implementation (15% ~750 words)

Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game.

## Evaluation (15% ~750 words)

One qualitative evaluation (your choice)

One quantitative evaluation (of your choice)

Description of how code was tested.

## Process (15% ~750 words)

Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together.

## Conclusion (10% ~500 words)

## Quality

Quality of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%)

## Documentation of code (5%)

## Individual contribution.

Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent.
