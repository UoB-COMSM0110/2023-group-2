Think aloud task 13th March

Facilitator: Gus Fowle
Observers: Joe Lever, Yibo Ma
Participants: Eamon and Bala

Ideas for improvement:

 - Pacman needs to interact with the Ghosts and there needs to be coins.
 - No clear objective.
 - The twist hasn't been implemented yet.
 - Make the map have full visibility for a few seconds before the game begins and limited visibility is implemented. Maybe also have more "full visibility" moments if you eat a ghost or eat a powerup etc.
 - Implement music throughout the whole gameplay.
 - Spawn location shouldn't be inside a wall.
 - Should have a theme to explain the twist?
 - The movement of the ghosts needs to be less "back-and-forth" (they need to move further)

Things they like:

 - The theme of the map / writing in the walls
 - Changing colours of the walls
 - Smooth movement and animation of pacman and ghosts.
