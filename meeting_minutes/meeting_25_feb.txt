25th February 2023

Present - Joe Lever, Gus Fowle, Yi Yin, Liz

Key points:

 - Decide on who does what for our game-jam session during reading week
 - Divide tasks up into the different classes as defined by our UML classes diagram to prevent conflicts when pushing to github.
 - Arrange a meeting with Yibo Ma during reading week to explain our progress as he was unable to attend.
 - Research a way to create a kanban board online which can be easily shared with the group to track our progress.

Task division for our gamejam:

 - Liz      - work on the "PacTheMan" class which contains the methods and attributes for the player.
 - Yi Yin   - work on the "Ghosts" class which integrates how the ghosts move around the board
 - Gus      - work on the "Board" class which defines the map in which the player will move
 - Joe      - work on the "PacTheMan" class after Liz leaves to create movement functionality, and create skeleton classes for all the other classes defined in the UML class diagram.
 - Yibo Ma  - TBD.

 - Mystery person???? - maybe raise the issue if he doesn't turn up after reading week?
