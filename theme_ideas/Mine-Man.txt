Theme: Pac-Man underground/in a mine (Mine-Man?)

Possible twists:

Flashlights/limited visibility: The tunnels are dark and Pac-Man must use a flashlight to navigate through them. However, the batteries on the flashlight will eventually run out, so Pac-Man must collect more batteries to keep it running.

Digging tunnels: Instead of simply navigating through a maze, Pac-Man can now dig tunnels through the soil and rocks to create his own path. This would add an element of strategy as Pac-Man can create shortcuts, escape routes, or even trap enemies. Perhaps Pac-Man can collect a pickaxe or the ‘power pellet’ could give Pac-Man this ability.

Mine carts: Pac-Man can jump into a mine cart and move around at high speeds (this could replace the slippy surfaces in the original design).

Dynamite: Pac-Man can use dynamite to blow up obstacles in his path, or to defeat enemies. However, he must also be careful not to blow himself up.

Hidden gems: ‘Hidden gems’ could replace ‘power pellets’ to fit the theme or they could a different type of item found in the walls whilst mining.

Big ghost: A ‘big ghost’ could appear infrequently that moves slowly but can move through walls
